You are tasked with building a full-featured church management system for SDSCC using the following Markdown files: admins.md, Auditor.md, contibutions.md, expenditure.md, members.md, overview.md, pastors.md, staff.md.

Instructions before building:

Read and analyze all files thoroughly.

If there are discrepancies, missing details, or conflicts, resolve them by updating the files.

If improvements, enhancements, or missing features are needed, update the MD files before implementation.

Prioritize correctness, consistency, and completeness of features in the system.

Implementation requirements:

Use Django with SQLite for development and CockroachDB/PostgreSQL for production deployment.

Build all dashboards with sidebars, hierarchical dropdowns, and modern mobile-friendly templates (TailwindCSS + Material UI).

Implement all roles: Mission Admin, Branch Admin/Executives, Auditors, Pastors, Staff, Members, with proper role-based access control.

Cover all functionalities: contributions, expenditures, attendance (Sabbath worship), payroll, announcements, sermons, groups, reporting, and auditing.

Focus on UI/UX flow improvements for efficient management of 1800+ members and 50+ pastors.

System must be modular, production-ready, and maintainable, with proper error handling and hierarchical navigation.

Maintain a milestone.md file that tracks features implemented, pending items, and project progress. Keep it updated throughout.

Avoid unnecessary documentation unless explicitly requested. Focus on building the system.

Output expectations:

Fully working Django project scaffold with apps for contributions, expenditures, members, attendance, pastors, staff, reports, and dashboards.

Modern UI templates with dashboards, sidebars, forms, and hierarchical dropdowns.

milestone.md file updated and reflecting current status.

Fully consistent system aligned with the content and improvements from the MD files.

Think critically, resolve discrepancies, suggest improvements, and then proceed to build the complete system.
