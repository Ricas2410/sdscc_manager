## **Mission Returns Management (General Admin Only)**

### **1. Purpose**

This feature enables the General Mission Admin to efficiently manage, monitor, and validate monthly financial returns submitted by branches across the country. It ensures accountability, easy tracking of outstanding payments, and a clear overview of branch financial compliance.

---

### **2. Dedicated Mission Returns Dashboard**

A dedicated page will be added to the General Admin’s navigation sidebar, providing centralized access to all mission return activities.

#### **2.1. Key Display Elements**

* Current month overview
* Summary cards (e.g., Total branches, Paid, Unpaid, Outstanding balance)
* Table showing all branches with:

  * Branch name
  * Region/Zone (for easier hierarchy filtering)
  * Amount due
  * Amount paid
  * Payment status (Paid / Not Paid / Partially Paid)
  * Action button (Mark as Paid, View History)

---

### **3. Monthly Tracking Features**

#### **3.1. Payment Recording**

* Admin can mark a branch’s monthly return as **Paid** once the funds are received.
* Admin can enter partial payments if applicable.
* System automatically timestamps the payment and logs the admin responsible.

#### **3.2. Pending & Outstanding Returns**

* Branches that have not submitted or completed their returns will appear under **Unpaid**.
* Any outstanding balances from previous months remain visible until fully cleared.
* Admin can view a branch’s complete return history, including:

  * Paid months
  * Unpaid months
  * Outstanding arrears

---

### **4. Sorting, Filtering, and Search**

Given the scale of the network (100+ branches), the dashboard will support:

* **Search by branch name**

* **Filter by:**

  * Region/Zone (hierarchy-based filtering)
  * Payment status (Paid, Unpaid, Partially Paid)
  * Month or Year
  * Outstanding only

* **Sort by:**

  * Branch name
  * Region
  * Payment status
  * Amount due or outstanding

This allows the General Admin to quickly locate and manage specific branches or regions.

---

### **5. Monthly Cycle Management**

The General Admin can:

* **Close the month** once all possible returns are recorded.

  * Closing a month locks it from further edits (unless reopened).
* **Open the next month** to begin tracking new returns automatically.
* View previous months via a selectable month/year dropdown.

This ensures a clean monthly workflow without data confusion or overlap.

---

### **6. Branch-Level Arrears Tracking**

If a branch owes money from previous months:

* Their arrears remain highlighted until settled.
* Admin can drill down into the branch profile to see:

  * Outstanding amounts
  * Payment timestamps
  * Months owed
  * Total historical payments

---

### **7. Sidebar and Quick Access**

The following adjustments will be made:

* Add a **Mission Returns** item to the General Admin sidebar.
* Include a **Quick Access link** on the dashboard homepage (e.g., “Manage Mission Returns”).
* Ensure the feature is available only to General Admin accounts.

---

### **8. Usability and Professionalism**

To support a national network of branches:

* The interface will be clean, data-driven, and optimized for fast navigation.
* Tables will support pagination for handling 100+ records.
* Filtering and sorting tools will be intuitive and positioned above the results for quick interaction.
* Clear status badges (e.g., Paid, Unpaid, Outstanding) make the interface easy to scan.
* Action buttons will be minimal, structured, and standardized across views for consistency.
